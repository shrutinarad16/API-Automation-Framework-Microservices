# Selenium Framework project for testing e-commerce website.

The project uses Selenium with Java, Maven and TestNG framework. 
Designed with POM pattern.
Supports Multiple Browsers.
Supports Headless Running.
Generates ExtentReport with screenshots of failed scripts.

## I tested these functionalities:
* Registration
* Logging in
* Logging out
* Changing Language
* Entering email for Newsletter
* Searching
* Saving and removing Items from the Wishlist
* Adding and removing Items from the cart
* Checking out 
* Closing Account


### Note: This project was for learning purposes and used a real website so some tests may fail over time.
